# SocialNetworkingKata

Website to demonstrate social networking Kata tasks

I have used Visual Studio 2019 to develop this webapp and I have learend and implemented MVC architecture. backend services are REST API which uses local instance of SQL Server db. NuGet is used as pacakge manager. I am still learning how to write unit tests using MSTest but it is not yet ready. I  wanted to push some basic feature where:

1. User can create/Update/Delete their profile.

2. User can publish content

3. Users can see timelines

4. The users can also follow other users. I am still fine tuning last piece where once followed user can see other users timeline and will update readme with more details once done.
